        "Description": "I'll try this again, I wasn't too specific last time I posted this question. As stated in the title, I'm an Aussie in Paris, I'm a 24 year old male. I've got another 5 nights here in Paris and while the Eiffel tower is indeed beautiful at night, I was hoping for some nightclub/bar recommendations in this fantastic city. I've walked the streets at night, primarily between my hostel (in Monmarte) and Gare du Nord. I've seen mainly only restaurants and the bars I've walked past seem quiet. I would love to find a good nightclub. I'm going to try and hit an Aussie pub I heard about at some point this week, but in case it sucks I would love some alternatives, besides, it would be pretty boring to hit the same place every night. I'm not on a particularly tight budget, but I don't want to drop 20 euro's on an entry fee, or pay 10 euro's for a drink. My pricing assumptions are likely to be way off because I haven't had a drink in the two days I've been here, the point is I just don't want to be ripped off and I'm not looking for anything too \"fancy\". I've already seen how expensive Paris is, so I'm prepared to be out of luck budget wise. I'm staying about a 10 minute walk away from Gare du Nord. I think the closest Metro is Poissonniere. Unless I'm completely blind I haven't seen any clubs in this area, then again I've only been here two nights. I would prefer something close because I'm not too sure how safe a late night walk or Metro ride would be, but if it means a good night out I'm prepared to take the risk. So, can you suggest anything? If you need any more info please let me know. Thanks in advance.",

It's a smaller, lesser known town, this is my first solo trip, and as a person who likes to do her research, it makes me slightly nervous that I can't find too many tours/guides/reviews on it (although, maybe I should take this as a good sign as I don't want somewhere touristy/crowded?) I've been doing some research but as this is a spontaneous trip I came on here for advice, ideas, and tips for anything Sayulita before I jet off Monday. Things I've planned/am interested in: -A trip to the Marietas Islands -Yoga, possibly a 1-day yoga retreat/relaxation day (I've been looking and I'm not sure that's an option), but any yoga studios you went to & enjoyed would be super appreciated! Vinyasa is my favorite practice. -Good hiking spots (Monkey Mountain Hike - has anyone done this?) -meeting people, eating delicious (vegetarian food), finding cool local goods & environments. Questions: -Did anyone ride the bus from PVR to Sayulita? Was it an alright experience? I've read mixed reviews, but it's a great deal as long as I am not unsafe. -Did you have large problems with the ATM's/getting pesos? How much cash did you bring before arriving to the country? If you have answers/experiences to share for any or all of these questions, know you'll be making me a happy fellow friend! Appreciate it. :)",

We are trying to decide if we should hike closer to the Seattle area (we are staying in West Seattle) or closer to the Gorge on the day of the concert.  We both love hiking but know nothing about Washington & have never hiked or spent much time there. We usually go for \"difficult\" trail ratings and we like panoramic views/high elevation/good-payoff-at-the-end hikes. We also know it is a very quick trip and don't want to spend too much time getting to our hiking destination. We also don't know much about the summer weather and how important it would be to find shaded trails v. open to the sun. Any advice is welcome!  We are also really love food and would welcome any food-related recommendations in either of those areas.",

This Saturday I will be in Lucerne and am looking forward to seeing the city as well as doing some hiking. However the weather and my student budget are making this difficult (to be clear I can't go any other day). It's supposed to be a bit rainy and in the morning, and honestly either way I can't afford the 100+ it costs to take the boat/gondola to Mt. Pilatus, so I don't think that will be happening. They have this listing for hiking trails, and I'm curious if any of you have one you would recommend? I can read about prices/times online but obviously it's impossible to get an idea of which would be most worthwhile in terms of the scenery based off of that. I'll likely do one of the circle walks listed at the bottom because they don't require paying for buses/trains etc. I would be interested in any advice overall. Thanks!",

I want to overcome my social anxiety and to escape my comfort zone to meet people and forge new relationships, hence why I want to stay in a hostel. I want to see some history, culture, architecture, hipster spots/good social settings (ironic for an introvert), museums and the normal touristy stuff - but without being like a typical tourist. I'm planning to buy two one-way flights from London to Vienna then Berlin to London. Rather than buying an Interrail ticket, which I believe is only worth it if you're a visiting loads of places with little planning. I wanted to get two high-speed train tickets: from Vienna to Prague; then Prague to Berlin, to take in the Central European scenery.  Are there any particular places to visit? Anything that can be recommended to me? Or just some tips for someone who is looking to escape their comfort zone and travel solo for the first time? If you've been to Berlin, Prague or Vienna, is there anything I should look out for?",

I'm looking to spend a couple of days in Vancouver and spend the remainder of the time doing outdoor activities, mainly hiking trails or climbing mountains, but I'm open to other suggestions too. I like hiking with nice views at the top, and walks that don't require any technical skills to reach the summit etc I am trying to plan my trip and not sure if I should base myself in Vancouver and do day trips or stay in other towns nearer to where the hiking trails are. It's important to note that I won't be able to rent a car since I'm too young, so I either have to use public transport or hitchhike (I know it's illegal in BC but apparently it's pretty common and easy to do and cops don't care so much?) EDIT: Thanks for the advice, I'll definitely take it in to consideration. Just to be clear I'm a 19 year old male, and I'm quite tall and muscular. I will most likely be travelling with another male friend and I've hitchhiked several times in Europe and in Ontario. I'm very street-wise and aware of my surroundings. However, with that said, I do take what you have said very seriously and hitchhiking will always be my last resort, it can definitely be very dangerous, especially in a place like BC.

(Of course, I'ma hit up Google too, but I thought I'd ask y'all too <3) Edit: Also, she's not really explored different different food cultures, so if you guys know of a good Indian, Sushi, Italian, Mexican; places to visit that would make my heart sing <3 <3 <3",

There are a few I've found which look interesting which are WOMB, Tokyoloose and HarlemTokyo but not 100% on what sort of style they are. We're preferably looking for a hip hop r&b club but could easily also go to a rock night out depending on what place has the best atmosphere.

Second point is that my current rental contract is until June, so I might end up moving to another place in Amstedam. Fit For Free seems like the most affordable month to month gym but the reviews online seem to point to lots of issues. Smart fit is another one which I saw, that looked promising.

Many thanks! Enjoy weekend EDIT: Ida-in If you like modern art the CoBrA museum in Amstelveen has very nice expositions regularly. The Jewish historical museum is also one of my favourites: not to busy and it shows a very interesting part of the city's history. shortys94 Ah many thanks, I think these are actually on the museum card too!

To make it even more fun I'm also a vegetarian (again not really by choice). Do you have any recommendations, for example veggie or gluten free restaurants who would be willing to adjust some of their dishes if necessary? I do have a kitchen in the place I'm staying, but part of the fun of travelling is eating out :) Thank you! EDIT: kuriosty Silvoplee is a vegetarian restaurant where you can pick your food from a large buffet table, and all options have comprehensive listings of ingredients. Tasty and nutritious food as well in a good location.  Amaranth7 Thank you! It's going on my list :) onoki I'm not an expert on the matter, but OmNam is a very tasty vegan restaurant even for non-vegans. They also mention that \"most of their food is gluten free\", so you might want to check it out.  Amaranth7 I'd already found this restaurant and they've already e-mailed me back even! So looks like this is a definite yes :)  My SO follows a similar diet (fodmap, gluten free) and said EMO happily followed a variety of restrictions for their party, when they mentioned the restrictions while ordering.

I apologize if a similar question has been asked in the past. My partner and I just moved to Vienna and will reside here for the next three months and are looking for some hikes that are within a 2-3 hour drive (or train ride) from Vienna. I know this applies to much of Austria (and Europe for that matter), but, we are looking for a hike that yields spectacular views of the surrounding peaks that isn't terribly physically demanding (minimal scrambling, not a technical hike, can be done within a day, etc.). I recently came across Wolfsberg and noticed through google maps that it has some peaks reaching just over 1500m- 2000m surrounding the town; anyone have any experience with Wolfsberg and the nearby hikes? It's only a short drive from Graz, so it may be nice to make a weekend out of it (one day hiking in/near Wolfsberg and one day exploring Graz). Any other recommendations are greatly appreciated, too!",
